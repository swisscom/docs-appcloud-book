The Gorouter uses this header to validate the request sent by the route service to the app route. The passphrase is configured in the cf-release manifest.<br><pre><code>properties<span>:</span><br> router<span>:</span><br>   route\_services\_secret<span>:</span> YOUR-SECRET-PASSPHRASE</code></pre><p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><span>:</span> The <code>route\_services\_secret</code> property should be a robust passphrase.
